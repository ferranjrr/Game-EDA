# Game-EDA
Here there is my AI player of the game The Purge. It was developed in the subject Data Structures and Algorithms ([EDA](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering/curriculum/syllabus/EDA)) in Facultat d'Informàtica de Barcelona ([FIB](https://www.fib.upc.edu/)), [UPC](https://www.upc.edu/ca). 

In the folder "game" you'll find a C++ file, [`AIPaco30.cc`](./game/AIPaco30.cc), my AI player.

In the folder "rules and documentation" it is specified the rules of the game and how to execute it.

Through this game I practiced the algorithms and data structures related with Graphs: 
Representations: adjacency matrices, adjacency lists and implicit representation. Depth-first search (DFS). Breadth-first search (BFS). Topological sort. Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths. Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees.

**Final mark: 9.06 out of 10.**
